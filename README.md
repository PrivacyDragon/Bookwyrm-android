# Bookwyrm-android
An Android application for Bookwyrm. Basically, it is just bookwyrm put into a 'webview' element.
What it does? It enables you to use BookWyrm on your Android phone without having to use a browser to go to it every time.
It can also open links to userpages of Bookwyrm users and it can scan ISBN codes.

This application works on: Android 6 and above.

And if you want to know, I am [`@StoryDragon@books.storydragon.nl`](https://books.storydragon.nl/user/storydragon) on BookWyrm.

For the ISBN-scanning I use the library zxing-android-embedded.
The barcode icon that is added for instances that do not have ISBN-scanning by default comes from the Remix Icon project.
